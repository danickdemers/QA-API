There are two continuous branches:

- `main`
- `dev`

### Branch name

```txt
<type>/<issue number>_<issue name>
```

where **type** is `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test` or `refactor`.

For example, `feat/42_awesome_feature`.

### Branch Creation

All branches need to be created **from `dev`** and associated with an issue.
